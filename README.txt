Here are some lecture notes I've made from the class. I would like to share them and if you would like please feel free to contribute. However, I would like to keep them compact and include only the basic definitions, concepts and algorithms instead of rewriting the whole lecture.

I'm a total newbie to AI so the notes contain even the very basic stuff. The notes are made in LaTeX.
